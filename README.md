Limitations & Warnings
===========
This repository is only a preview of the robot. The meshes contained within
the ubr1_description package are not final, may change in the final release
and will certainly be tuned for size and appearance before the final release.

This repository is currently designed to be used with ROS Hydro and
Gazebo 1.9. When the UBR-1 ships in the second half of 2014, it will ship with
ROS Indigo and this repository will be deprecated.
